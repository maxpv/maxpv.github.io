# Data Science and Machine Learning playground

This is a compilation of [Jupyter](jupyter.org) notebooks, where I'll be playing with machine learning, data visualization and data exploration.

You can also find on this repository:
- My [snippets](snippets.md).
- The GoolgleCloud [installation notes](installation.md) for a quick installation of Jupyter+Keras+Tensorflow+... on a GoogleCloud virtual machine.


## Problems

### Leaves [(notebook)](https://github.com/maxpv/maxpv.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/leaves.ipynb)
Kaggle Challenge proposed in 2017, of [leaf classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification/data). It's an interesting dataset because there is 16 sample for each of the 99 species with around 200 features per instance. I mainly focused on reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.

### AdTracking Fraud Detection (work in progress)
Kaggle Challenge proposed by Talking Data. The objective is to "predict whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app advertisement."

### Parkinson Telemonitoring (work in progress)
[Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons+Telemonitoring) of voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease, built by the University of Oxford in collaboration with 10 medical centers in the US and INtel Corporation.
