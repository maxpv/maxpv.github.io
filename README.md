# Data Science and Machine Learning playground

This is a compilation of [Jupyter](jupyter.org) notebooks, where I'll be playing with machine learning, data visualization and data exploration.

You can also find on this repository:
- My [snippets](snippets.md).
- The GoolgleCloud [installation notes](installation.md) for a quick installation of Jupyter+Keras+Tensorflow+... on a GoogleCloud virtual machine.


## Problems

### Leaves [(notebook)](notebooks/leaves.ipynb)
Kaggle Challenge proposed in 2017, of [leaf classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification/data). It's an interesting dataset because there is 16 sample for each of the 99 species with around 200 features per instance. I mainly focused on reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.

### AdTracking Fraud Detection
Kaggle Challenge proposed by Talking Data. The objective is to "predict whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app advertisement."
